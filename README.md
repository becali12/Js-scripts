# Js-scripts

This repository contains some web3 related JS scripts. 

**send.js** - can be used to easily send a transaction, can be more convenient than using Metamask for testing other scripts


**confirmations.js** - can be used to check the number of confirmations a transaction has on the blockchain (Ropsten network by default)


**watch.js && watchSubscribe.js** - used for monitoring incoming ETH transactions to an address
